Most of the code is dedicated to data management and visualization. There's a python script that runs UMAP based on existing PC data.
PC data for the UKBB was provided to me so I didn't generate it myself.
PC data for the HRS (and HRS/1KGP data) was generated in PLINK.
Work done on the 1KGP data can be found in another repo: https://github.com/diazale/1KGP_dimred
